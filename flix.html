            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Browsing has arisen as a necessary means of navigating the cluttered digital sphere. There is so much out there, yet so little feels right. When people browse, they make dozens of decisions about what they encounter, funneling the chaos of abundance into more manageable streams of information. This all happens quickly, almost automatically. The ability to perform this task&mdash;recognizing what is and is not &ldquo;for you&rdquo;&mdash;requires taste, experience, and cultural knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                Increasingly, everyday decisions about what we watch, listen to, and buy are mediated through recommendation systems that try to approximate and appeal to our tastes. The Netflix Recommendation System (NRS) is one of the most robust content recommendation systems in the world. The NRS is comprised of a set of sophisticated algorithms that personalize viewers&rsquo; experiences by suggesting movies and TV shows based on their user data. Netflix employs a high level of personalization not just in <em>what</em> it recommends to users, but also <em>how</em> these recommendations are presented.
            </p>
            <p>
                In cultural sociology, significant attention has been paid to how taste and classification shape social distinctions and hierarchies, yet the activation of these processes in the context of browsing has yet to be explored. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research has extensively investigated user interactions with digital interfaces and algorithms, but often without integrating a nuanced understanding of how culture influences the browsing process. Scholarship on Netflix has detailed the mechanics and impacts of its recommendation system, yet there is a lack of user-centric studies that examine real-time browsing behavior. This study aims to bridge these gaps by employing a user-centric approach that not only showcases real-time browsing behaviors but also examines how cultural knowledge and platform design facilitate decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>By integrating methodological techniques from HCI with sociological models of culture and cognition, this study explores the decision-making processes of regular Netflix users while they browse Netflix, with a particular focus on how their consumption choices are influenced by cultural knowledge and the platform&rsquo;s recommendation system. By interviewing and observing participants while they browsed, the research aims to untangle how personal preferences, cultural knowledge, user interfaces, and algorithmic suggestions facilitate individual&rsquo;s navigation through and selection of content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the NRS already provides highly personalized recommendations, participants often found these insufficient to pinpoint the movies and shows that genuinely piqued their interest. To move beyond the initial filtering of the algorithm, users employed a filtering system of their own by classifying content along a variety of valences that drew on their cultural knowledge. These techniques were numerous, but I describe five that were particularly prevalent in my interviews: (1) identifying tropes, (2) making associations, (3) gauging situational suitability, (4) ascribing content perceived audiences, and (5) considering its social and moral acceptability. I propose a speculative model that describes browsing as an iterative process of search, discovery, evaluation, and selection, where users oscillate between instinctual action and deliberate information-seeking behaviors depending on the depth of their browse. Overall, browsing Netflix is collaboration between the user and the NRS, where proactive user engagement, platform affordances, and algorithmic suggestions converge to guide the discovery and selection of content.

            <h2>The Netflix Recommendation System</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the NRS requires understanding its essential function as a business imperative. Transitioning to a streaming service in 2007 shifted Netflix&rsquo;s priorities as an organization from a retail video-rental business towards something that resembled a tech company. While Netflix promoted their streaming service and the content it comprised, they also marketed their innovations in user-interface personalization and data-driven content acquisition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User retention is vital to Netflix&rsquo;s current business model because it directly impacts the platform&rsquo;s profitability and long-term sustainability. Unlike its competitors, Netflix&rsquo;s financial success depends solely on its ability to attract and retain subscribers (Spangler 2022). Netflix does not siphon users from or into larger media ecosystems, nor is it tethered to other pre-existing products or services (e.g. Amazon Prime, Apple TV+). It is not building off a legacy media brand either (e.g. HBO Max, Peacock, Disney+). And, until November 2022, when the company introduced its ad-supported subscription tier, Netflix did not generate advertising revenue (e.g. Peacock, Hulu). By keeping subscribers satisfied, Netflix aims to improve user retention and minimize churn. Loyal subscribers who remain engaged with the platform contribute to higher viewership and engagement metrics, which are crucial for attracting creators and negotiating favorable licensing contracts. Crucial to this endeavor of improving user retention is the NRS.

                <p>
                    The homepage is the primary user interface of the NRS. Since Netflix does not present its users with all 6,000 + titles in their content corpus, everything on the homepage is a recommendation. In a 2015 paper, Netflix researchers claimed the recommendation system &ldquo;influences choice for about 80% of hours streamed at Netflix;&rdquo; the other 20% comes from search (Gomez-Uribe and Hunt 2015). Constructing the Netflix homepage&mdash;a process well-documented through Netflix proprietary documents and blog posts&mdash;requires complex algorithmic design and deep human expertise. The homepage features a marquee banner, displaying a highlighted movie or TV show, followed by a series of horizontally scrolling rows categorized by genres, viewing history, trending content, and personalized suggestions. There are four levels of personalization within each row: the row&rsquo;s heading or &ldquo;thematic container,&rdquo; the titles within it, the order in which the titles are arranged, and the thumbnails chosen to represent them. According to a 2019 Netflix corporate deck, a team of in-house experts &ldquo;meticulously tag each title with a rich taxonomy of 200 different story data points that form the basis of thematic containers&rdquo; (Sudeep 2019). Each title may end up belonging to many different containers.

                    Thumbnails play an outsized role in influencing user&rsquo;s decisions. A 2014 Netflix research study found that 82% of users&rsquo; overall focus was directed at thumbnails (Nelson 2016). The final step in constructing the homepage is to personalize these thumbnails by selecting and displaying the most engaging and relevant thumbnail images for movies and TV shows to individual users. In a 2017 blog post, Netflix engineers noted that &ldquo;this project is the first instance of personalizing not just what we recommend but also how we recommend to our members&rdquo; (Chandrashekar et al. 2017). Since then, this has not been their only project in personalization. About a month into my data collection, Netflix released &ldquo;dynamic sizzle,&rdquo; a personalized montage of clips from different titles strung together into &ldquo;a seamless A/V asset that gets members excited about upcoming launches&rdquo; (Wobbe and Kwok 2023).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prior to their global integration in 2016, Netflix&rsquo;s collaborative filtering algorithms and recommendations were limited to the data extracted from users within a specific region (Stenovec 2016). This expansion equipped the NRS with the capability to identify individuals with similar tastes and group them into taste communities, clusters of which there are over 2000 (Shattuc 2020). Through the creation of this new consumer categorization scheme, Netflix has perfected what Rogers (2013) calls <em>postdemographic</em> profiling: by generating insights exclusively from user behavior, algorithms are supposedly freed from traditional indexes of identity. In principle, the NRS is demographic-neutral. In reality, the company achieves scale and profitability by appealing to economically viable and culturally dominant demographic groups (Cohn 2019).

            <h2>Literature Review</h2>
                <h4>Taste and Classification</h4>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>
                        Taste is key to understanding algorithms as cultural interlopers as it is both the input and output of algorithmic processes. Bourdieu proposed that taste preferences are not individual or innate but deeply influenced by one&rsquo;s position in social space, structured by various forms of capital and embodied through the habitus. Classification, from Bourdieu&rsquo;s perspective, is a manifestation of these tastes, reflecting and reproducing social distinctions and hierarchies; hence, &ldquo;taste classifies, and it classifies the classifier&rdquo; (Bourdieu 1984 6). Peterson (1992) challenged assumption that taste is a strictly hierarchical manifestation of class through his model of <em>cultural omnivorousness</em>, where individuals increasingly engage in diverse taste practices that transcend their social position. While Bourdieu emphasized the exclusivity of highbrow culture as a source of cultural capital, Peterson suggested that the ability to appreciate and engage with a wide range of cultural forms may also serve as a form of capital, signaling cosmopolitanism and higher social status. Lahire (2006) also critiqued the notion of a unified habitus, arguing that individuals have <em>dissonant</em> tastes, exercising contradictory preferences across different cultural fields. The classification of cultural objects contributes to the social construction of taste by defining what is considered valuable, worthy, or prestigious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Classification, the invisible infrastructure that provides structure to our social lives, involves the organization of cultural objects into distinct genres, types, or categories. Bowker and Star (2000) define a classification system is &ldquo;a set of boxes (real or metaphorical) into which things can be put to then do some kind of work.&rdquo; So then, what work do classifications do? Classifications create and reinforce social hierarchies and norms. They are not merely reflections of pre-existing social orders but actively construct them by categorizing the world in specific ways. Classification is also a form of boundary work, where people create separations between themselves and what they deem to be above or below them by determining what is included or excluded from categories. By analyzing data from the 1993 General Social Survey about musical dislikes, Bryson (1996) found that people use cultural taste to reinforce symbolic boundaries between themselves and categories of people they dislike. Contrary to Bourdieu&rsquo;s hypothesis of musical exclusiveness increasing with education, like Peterson, Bryson, found that higher education correlates with broader musical tastes, suggesting a form of cultural tolerance. However, this tolerance is not indiscriminate; genres associated with lower education levels (e.g., gospel, country, rap, and heavy metal) are more likely to be rejected by the musically tolerant, revealing a pattern of exclusion based on class rather than mere taste diversity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite paying a great deal of attention to cultural taste and its consequences, in sociological research, generic taste has traditionally been handled as a coarse thing. Surveys ask whether people like rock or blues music, horror films or romantic comedies. This generalization not only does a disservice to the incredibly granular ways in which individuals classify cultural objects, it ignores the rich array of knowledge people use to do so.</p>
                </div>
                <h4>Cultural Knowledge in Action</h4>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>
                        There is also a rich sociological debate surrounding whether cultural knowledge serves as a motivation or justification for people&rsquo;s behavior. In the beginning, the idea that people were motivated by the values they learned from society was foundational to sociological theory. Weber&rsquo;s concept of <em>Wertrationalit&auml;t</em>, often translated as &ldquo;value-rational action,&rdquo; posited that some actions are performed because of the belief that it is worth doing for its own sake, according to some ethical or moral principle that the actor holds dear. This type of action is driven more by a commitment to certain values than by consideration of outcomes or consequences. Building from this theory, scholars in the motivation camp, primarily those who study religion (Lakoff 2002; Smith 2003; Hitlin and Piliavin 2004; Smith and Denton 2005), argued that internalized values and beliefs influence actions by providing a sense of moral duty or purpose. This perspective suggests that cultural meanings can shape behavior by operating below the level of consciousness, influencing individuals on a more intuitive level. Beyond just rationalizing actions, cultural beliefs and values can serve as internalized motivators that guide individuals towards certain actions and outcomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other side, the justification camp focused on the post hoc rationalization of actions. Here, cultural knowledge has been understood as a set of tools people &ldquo;pick up and put down&rdquo; at their disposal (Swidler 2001 24) or &ldquo;a repertoire [people] use to make sense of their thoughts and actions&rdquo; (Kaufman 2004 340). In her study of middle-class American marriages, Swidler found little evidence that ideology motivates action, rather &ldquo;people tend to trim their philosophy to fit their action commitments&rdquo; (Swidler 2001 148). This perspective aligns with the idea that individuals draw from a set of cultural scripts (Mills 1940) to perform in social settings (Goffman 1959).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vaisey (2009) sought to bridge these two perspectives with a dual-process model of culture in action, distinguishing between discursive (conscious, justificatory) and practical (unconscious, motivational) modes of culture and cognition. He leveraged panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to illustrate how individuals may not articulate clear principles of moral judgment (aligning with the justification camp) yet display behaviors strongly predicted by their moral and cultural scripts (aligning with the motivation camp). Discursive culture pertains to the conscious, articulated aspects of culture that individuals use to rationalize their actions. Practical culture, however, refers to the unconscious, taken-for-granted knowledge and dispositions that guide behavior in a more automatic and intuitive manner; what Lizardo (2017) calls non-declarative, that is, culture that is &ldquo;phenomenologically opaque and not open to linguistic articulation.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vaisey&rsquo;s model has gained significant traction, contributing to the rise of a new subfield, the sociology of culture and cognition. In a recent paper, Vaisey urged scholars siloed within this subfield to engage more directly with other disciplines (Vaisey 2021). I respond to this call to action by engaging with scholarship and methodological tactics from HCI.

                <h4>Studies of Browsing Behavior</h4>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>
                        Most empirical studies of digital browsing behavior have been conducted by researchers within the fields of HCI and Library and Information sciences. Some recent scholarship has focused on how people navigate social media platforms and how through their interactions, users are able or unable to evade algorithmic surveillance and influence outcomes. Yeung (2017) proposed that algorithms influence user decisions in the form of a <em>hypernudge</em>, &ldquo;a particular form of choice architecture that alters people&rsquo;s behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.&rdquo; Witzenberger (2018) introduced the term <em>hyperdodge</em> to describe a strategy where users intentionally feed manipulated or misleading data to algorithms. This practice can disrupt the predictive capabilities of these algorithms, challenging their objectives and potentially affecting their accuracy. Witzenberger&rsquo;s interviews revealed that while users may not fully understand the technical workings of algorithms, they are aware of their presence and influence. This awareness leads to the development of resistance practices that range from simple avoidance tactics to more sophisticated methods of data manipulation. Similarly, Ellison and a team of researchers explored the motivations and implications behind the &ldquo;non-click,&rdquo; instances where users deliberately decide not to click on digital content they have viewed or engaged with. Interviewing and eye-tracking Facebook users revealed three audience-related concerns, namely participants not wanting the poster, their network, and the platform itself perceiving their engagement with a particular post (Ellison et al. 2020). These results seem to suggest that social consequences influence online interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early studies of browsing behavior, especially those in Library and Information sciences, examined browsing as an information-seeking activity. Branch (2000) investigated how 12-15-year-old students sought out information using Microsoft Encarta 98, a digital encyclopedia originally sold as a CD. She found that while all participants were able to answer the research questions that prompted their search, they used a variety of search terms, categories, and strategies to do so. These tactics change when users struggle to find what they are looking for. Researchers at Google found that when having difficulty finding information, users formulate more diverse queries, used advanced operators more, and spend more time on the search results page compared to the successful tasks (Aula, Khan, and Guan 2010). These studies demonstrate that fundamentally, browsing is a quest for information. However, further research has shown that cultural differences influence the types of information people are looking for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A limited body of HCI research has examined how cultural differences can influence browsing behavior and interface acceptance. Chau and a team of researchers examined how students from the U.S. and Hong Kong differed in their online consumer behavior while browsing automobile manufacturers&rsquo; websites. They found that American and Chinese participants had different motivations for using the internet and that simply translating websites into a different language is insufficient without considering the deeper cultural nuances that influence user interaction and perception (Chau et al. 2002). Evers and Day (1997) researched the influence of culturally specific design preferences and their impact on attitudes and behaviors towards interface acceptance. The study confirms that design preferences rooted in cultural background significantly affect user acceptance of interfaces. For instance, Chinese users&rsquo; interface acceptance is influenced more by system usefulness driven by their design preferences, whereas Indonesian users place more emphasis on the system&rsquo;s ease of use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While HCI scholarship has considered the importance of cultural adaptivity in software design and the influence of cultural background on online behavior, overall, the field is in need of more robust theories and models of culture. Most papers lack a model of culture; they merely use the word, and sometimes incorrectly by equating it with nationality (Clemmensen and Roese 2010). As digital interfaces and algorithmic systems increasingly govern social and cultural life, there should be more collaboration between sociologists and technologists. By turning to sociology&rsquo;s extensive literature on culture, HCI research can gain a deeper understanding of the nuanced ways culture influences human interaction with technology, offering a more complex and effective framework for designing and studying culturally adaptive systems.

                <h4>Scholarship of Netflix</h4>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>
                        The evolution of the NRS is well documented in a wide breadth of scholarship that includes Netflix&rsquo;s proprietary research documents and the work of external academics. Some scholars have explored the personalization strategies of Netflix by examining thumbnail optimization. Thumbnails are excellent sites for research as they are tangible embodiments of algorithmic processes in action, &ldquo;providing a face to something that is often lost in the world of big data&rdquo; (Eklund 2022 738). Pajkovic (2022) set up three Netflix user profiles, each with distinct taste personas, in an attempt to reverse-engineer the operational logics of the NRS. Over two weeks, Pajkovic interacted with the NRS daily by selecting one new film or television show for each fictional user to watch based on their predetermined tastes. He observed and recorded changes in each profile&rsquo;s homepage as they became increasingly personalized. By the end of the experiment, &ldquo;when identical titles were offered to each profile, they almost always had different artwork images&rdquo; (Pajkovic 2022). Pajkovic&rsquo;s results suggest that the NRS&rsquo;s circular logic tends to reinforce users&rsquo; existing preferences i.e., if a user watches certain genres or titles, the NRS is more likely to recommend similar content, potentially creating an echo chamber of content that mirrors the user&rsquo;s historical data. Other qualitative studies of the perceptions and impacts of the NRS adopted indirect methods for collecting user feedback. Gaw (2022) used a commercial tool connected to the Twitter API to collect and analyze tweets containing keywords directly related to the NRS. After filtering, tweets were coded and examined alongside themes identified from previously analyzed proprietary press releases, corporate documentation, and media discourse about the NRS. This method aimed to uncover recurring patterns and highlight the tensions, inconsistencies, and contradictions in the accounts of the NRS, as constructed by its engineers, depicted in the media, and experienced by users. She proposes the concept of &ldquo;algorithmic logics&rdquo; to define the assumptions, processes, and mechanisms that govern the construction of taste within the platform. Gaw argues that on Netflix, taste-making is constituted by four algorithmic logics&mdash;datafication, reconfiguration, interpellation, and reproduction&mdash;and that these logics reappropriate traditional mechanisms of social control and have created new ways to engineer cultural processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Researchers have also conducted studies of the NRS that involve real users of the platform. Schaffner and a team of researchers interviewed 20 regular Netflix users, asking about their experiences and perceptions of features in the Netflix platform design that may affect their sense of agency. Participants expressed that even while using a variety of strategies to manage their time on Netflix, design features such as autoplay and a lack of stopping cues often influenced them into watching more than they had planned to. Furthermore, the design of the homepage and its emphasis on recommendations influenced what the participants chose to watch. Most participants were not thrilled about this, preferring &ldquo;more human&rdquo; recommendations from friends and family over the algorithmically generated recommendations pushed by the NRS. Overall, the study concluded that &ldquo;a user&rsquo;s sense of agency was at odds with the platform&rsquo;s design,&rdquo; especially when it came to content selection and time spent on the platform (Schaffner et al. 2023).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While Netflix&rsquo;s technical papers and blog posts illustrate how their algorithms work, interactions of people with these algorithms reveal how they are not working as intended. Within cultural sociology, there has been a great deal of research about taste, classification, and how cultural knowledge influences people&rsquo;s behavior; however, this research fails to consider how these processes are enacted through browsing content recommendation systems like the NRS. Within HCI, there have been empirical studies investigating browsing behavior and user agency in algorithmic systems, but the role of cultural knowledge in content selection has been largely unexplored. Scholars of the NRS have presented a somewhat dystopian vision of the effects of personalization algorithms, where users passively accept recommendations, but there have been few user-centric studies, none of which have explicitly examined the browsing processes of users in real time. By borrowing methodological techniques from the field of HCI and Vaisey&rsquo;s dual model of culture in action, this study aims to present a novel user-centric approach that scrutinizes real-time browsing behaviors to investigate how cultural knowledge and algorithmic mediation interact within the browsing process of Netflix users.

            <h2>Methods & Data</h2>
                <p>
                    To explore how Netflix users implement cultural knowledge while browsing, I conducted 10 semi-structured interviews between October 2023 and April 2024. These interviews lasted 1 hour and 46 minutes on average and took place at Crerar Library on the University of Chicago campus. During these interviews I asked participants questions about their Netflix habits, external sources of recommendation, and to think-aloud during and after they completed a series of browsing tasks. The research protocol was reviewed by the University of Chicago&rsquo;s Human Subjects Institutional Review Board and deemed exempt from further review.

            <div class="subsection">
                <p>
                    Regular Netflix users in Chicago, aged 21-34, were selected as the population for this study. Regular Netflix users (defined here as those who use the platform at least once a week) were chosen because of their familiarity Netflix&rsquo;s user interface and their increased likelihood of having developed browsing strategies and opinions about the platform. Young adults residing in Chicago were chosen due to their relative technical dexterity and accessibility to the researcher. This study implemented a multi-faceted recruitment strategy beginning with the distribution of informative flyers at the David Rubenstein Forum and various public spaces around Hyde Park, leveraging the researcher&rsquo;s workplace networks and the area&rsquo;s high foot traffic for diverse participant outreach. Six of the participants were University of Chicago graduate and undergraduate students. All participants were compensated with $30 gift cards.

                <p>
                    This study&rsquo;s primary site of investigation is the Netflix homepage, the user interface of the NRS. This focus allows for an examination of the interaction between users and the NRS during the browsing process. A study of browsing could have taken on many forms and focused on any number of platforms; the decision to concentrate on Netflix users&rsquo; search for content was intentional. Because of their length, picking a movie or show to watch is a more consequential choice than selecting a YouTube video or TikTok, often requiring deeper consideration and more research before the user feels ready to commit. Netflix was selected because&mdash;compared to other streaming platforms&mdash;it offers a virtually unparalleled level of personalization integrated into its user experience and recommendations. Additionally, the popularity and ubiquity of Netflix content provides an opportunity to observe users&rsquo; symbolic references and inquire about content they have &ldquo;heard of&rdquo; but have not seen.

            <h4>Interview Structure</h4>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p>
                    The semi-structured interview was designed to probe how Netflix users employ cultural knowledge to facilitate their browsing process. The interview procedure consisted of four parts: introductory questions, personalized and impersonalized browsing tasks, browsing task review, and concluding questions. At the start of each interview, I asked the participant about their tastes, viewing habits, feature usage, and external sources of recommendation. After that, the participant logged in to their Netflix account and completed the first two browsing tasks on their personalized profile. The second set of browsing tasks took place on a &ldquo;default&rdquo; account with no viewing history to emulate an impersonalized browsing environment. I tested these two conditions to compare the potential differences in browsing tactics across personalized and impersonalized browsing environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the interview guide provided foundational structure, context-specific questions were necessary to probe implicit judgments (e.g. &ldquo;What makes it look dumb to you?&rdquo;). As the participant browsed, I would ask follow-up questions based on what they said or did. After completing the browsing tasks, the participant and I reviewed the screen-recorded footage together in an attempt to explicate their browsing process. During the browsing task review, I asked more impromptu questions that required the participant to explain their rationale behind certain actions (e.g. &ldquo;Why did you click on <em>Whiplash</em>?&rdquo;), entertain hypotheticals (&ldquo;How about <em>Love is Blind</em>?&rdquo;), and reflect on a string of decisions that led them somewhere on the page (&ldquo;How did you get to &lsquo;Movies Based on Real Life?&rsquo;&rdquo;). At the end of the interview I asked the participant to reflect on their experience browsing Netflix, the efficacy of its personalized recommendations, and theorize about the NRS&rsquo; mechanics and innerworkings.

                <h5>Browsing Tasks</h5>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>
                        Browsing tasks were designed to encourage participants to engage with the Netflix interface in ways that would reveal their browsing strategies and decision-making processes. To avoid participants choosing titles they already watched, they were instructed not to pick things they had seen before. Additionally, these browsing tasks were ambivalent to genre and format to encourage participants to consider as many titles as possible. Two types of browsing tasks were used:
                    </p>
                    <p class="indented-text">
                        1. Open-Ended: Participants were asked to find something they were in the mood to watch at the time of the interview.<br>  
                        2. Situational: Based on information provided by participants earlier in the interview, a situational task was created. For example, if a participant mentioned they often watch Netflix while doing chores, I would ask them to find something to watch while folding laundry. This task was designed to simulate a real-life scenario that influences their content selection process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For each participant, identical prompts were used in both the personalized and impersonalized environments. While these artificial browsing tasks motivated the participant&rsquo;s search, they primarily served to initiate the browsing process. The goal of the browsing tasks was to examine the sequence of choices, distinctions, and navigational behaviors that led participants to their final content selection, not to highlight what was ultimately chosen.

                <h5>Thinking Out Loud</h5>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <p>
                        While participants browsed the Netflix homepage, I asked them to think aloud, verbalizing their thought processes, intuitive judgements, confusions, and folk theories. Originally hailing from cognitive science, the think aloud method is used widely in HCI research to understand how people work with digital products and interfaces. With the most common approach, concurrent think aloud (CTA), users perform a task and verbalize it at the same time. However, researchers have raised concerns about reactivity, the way in which participants alter their behavior in response to being observed or having to articulate their thought processes aloud. These concerns about CTA have led to the emergence of retrospective think aloud (RTA), a method where participants describe their thought processes and decision-making after completing a task, rather than during the task itself. Retrospective think aloud has used to examine why Facebook users choose not to interact with certain content on their feed (Ellison et al. 2020) and how students seek out information using a digital encyclopedia (Branch 2000). I decided to use a combined CTA-RTA approach because I wanted to gauge how participants made decisions in real-time while also hearing post-hoc reflections on their navigational process. &nbsp;

            <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p>
                    Using an inductive approach, interview transcripts were qualitatively coded to identify emergent themes and patterns in how users evaluate content. This process began with locating when and where participants were engaging in classification. Following that, I generated specific subcodes based on the knowledge or information participants used to make these classifications (see fig. 2.1 for codebook). Additionally, screen recordings of the browsing sessions were utilized to complement the interview transcripts, providing necessary nuance and context.

            <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>
                    When Netflix users encounter the homepage, they are met with a deluge of information. How they make sense of it all&mdash;turning inferences into distinctions into selections&mdash;was the subject of this study. My investigation was primarily motivated by two research questions:
                </p>
                <p class="indented-text">
                    RQ1: How do Netflix users employ cultural knowledge while browsing?<br>
                    RQ2: How is this process mediated through and facilitated by the NRS?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found that participants employed cultural knowledge in their browsing process by classifying content to make sense of an overwhelming abundance of choices. This classification system, which I detail in the first section of my results, was crucial to how the Netflix users I spoke to decided what to watch. In the second section, I propose a speculative model that describes browsing as an iterative process, where users oscillate between instinctual action and deliberate decision-making depending on the depth of their browse. With this model in mind, I discuss some of the common browsing strategies participants utilized to narrow the scope of their search and source additional information. In the third section, I reflect on how browsing is a collaborative effort between the user and the NRS, where proactive engagement and algorithmic suggestion come together to facilitate content discovery and selection.

            <h3>Classifying Content</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p>
                    The NRS automatically presents recommendations to users based on generic categories. These categories are often already highly specific, like &ldquo;Revenge Action Thrillers&rdquo; or &ldquo;TV Dramedies Featuring a Strong Female Lead,&rdquo; but rarely are these genres fine-grained enough to identify movies or shows that the user is actually interested in. To go beyond the initial filtering of the NRS, users employ a filtering system of their own by classifying content along a variety of valences to digest the information presented to them on the homepage. These techniques are numerous, but I describe five that were particularly prevalent in my interviews: (1) identifying tropes, (2) making associations, (3) gauging situational suitability, (4) ascribing content perceived audiences, and (5) considering its social and moral acceptability.

                <h4>Tropes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Netflix users I spoke to classified content using their knowledge of tropes: themes, motifs, and clich&eacute;s embedded in a show or movie&rsquo;s plot. This process involved the participant identifying a piece of information from a thumbnail, preview, or description and recognizing a trope based on that. Genres serve as broad categorizations of media, characterized by shared conventions, settings, themes, and narrative structures. Tropes, on the other hand, become recognizable through their repeated use across various media. While genres categorize the overarching framework of narratives, tropes delve into specifics, detailing how stories within these broad categories differentiate themselves. While browsing, tropes functioned as a narrative shorthand, enabling participants to infer a film&rsquo;s plot without actually watching it. By recognizing Gerard Butler from the thumbnail, U6 quickly pegged <em>Hunter Killer</em> as one of those movies where a &ldquo;retired CIA guy gets called back to action.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <div class="thumbnail_img"><img src="images/context/hunterkiller.jpg"></div>
                    <blockquote>
                        I know this guy. This seems kind of cool. Top ten. I might watch. Seems kind of a little bit, um, bro-y, action, whatever. So it might be a little too basic &hellip; classic, like, missile military guy, action, uh, save the world &hellip; Gerard Butler, like that&rsquo;s classic him &hellip; You know, retired CIA guy gets called back to action because he&rsquo;s the only one who can do it!&nbsp; &hellip; I guarantee you there&rsquo;s a dozen movies with him where he&rsquo;s the military guy saving the day and it&rsquo;s like, okay, been there done that.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This classification led U6 to deem the movie as maybe something he would watch &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m doing laundry or something&rdquo; but not compelling enough to dedicate his full attention due to its perceived lack of originality and narrative depth. U6&rsquo;s discernment&mdash;bored by the redundancy of the trope yet still considering the movie for casual watching&mdash;was made possible by combining the information he was picking up on from the thumbnail with his knowledge of other films where a &ldquo;retired CIA guy gets called back to action.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Participants also used tropes to distinguish between what they did and did not like within a specific subgenre. U2 liked romance reality, so I asked, &ldquo;what about <em>Love Island</em>?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;the ones where they&rsquo;re wearing bikinis and have like a fanny pack with the team-building exercises are just not my thing.&rdquo; However, she did like romance reality that used some sort of technology to mediate the interactions between the contestants&mdash;things like <em>The Circle</em> and <em>Too Hot to Handle</em>&mdash;and ended up selecting <em>Deep Fake Love</em>. Because U2 has a nuanced understanding of the thematic and aesthetic elements of the romance reality genre, she was able to pick up on subtle variations between shows to make a more informed decision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users&rsquo; tendency to seek out tropes to evaluate content extended to episode-level information. U4 cared a lot about what happens during episodes of <em>Cold Case Files </em>and would cherry-pick them based on their plot.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        I am very particular about the kind of unsolved mystery or cold case they&rsquo;re dealing with &hellip; The ones where it&rsquo;s like, you can kinda tell it's a suicide and the family can't accept it is too depressing for me.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        She even recognized language within an episode description that suggested a resolution, saying &ldquo;this one implies that there is an ending to it to it because &lsquo;unraveling a dark family secret.&rsquo;&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <div class="description_img"><img src="images/context/altoona.png"></div>
                    <p>
                        U4&rsquo;s browsing behavior&mdash;parsing through episodes descriptions looking for tropes&mdash;is in part driven by her knowledge of these tropes and her preferences for some over others. This user is not merely interested in murder mysteries, she specifically wants the murder mysteries where it is obvious there was a murder, and it will be resolved. Because she has seen so many murder mysteries, she knows what she likes, what information to look for, and where to find it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But tropes and the narrative elements they suggested were not always as crucial to participants. U1, who also enjoys crime television, seemed to care a lot less about the plot of these shows and would put them on as background noise. In fact, he experienced a formulaic plot as an asset, citing his relationship with <em>Criminal Minds</em>.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        I don&rsquo;t really care about, you know, the greater plot, if fucking Spencer Reed is gonna get his girlfriend or not. I&rsquo;m just there for the skit, the routine. What is it? It opens up. Some guy&rsquo;s getting fucking murdered. Where is he? Who is he? The team flies out. I like that repetitiveness, that&rsquo;s why my number one genre on Netflix is probably crime.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        U4&rsquo;s meticulous selection process, driven by her desire for particular plot outcomes and her ability to discern narrative cues from episode descriptions, highlights how specific tropes can significantly impact viewer choice. Conversely, U1&rsquo;s appreciation for the predictability and routine of shows like <em>Criminal Minds</em> suggests that the familiarity and repetition of tropes can also enhance viewing experience. However, they can also detract from a film&rsquo;s attractiveness, as seen with U6&rsquo;s evaluation of <em>Hunter Killer</em>. This suggests that the significance of tropes varies based on individual viewer investment and preference. Recognizing a trope requires first knowing it exists; therefore trope recognition was limited to genres that the participants knew well. Tropes are one way that users go beyond the coarse genre labels to make fine-grained classifications necessary to identify what they really like.
                    </p>
                <h4>Associations</h4>
                    <p>
                        Browsing the Netflix homepage while instructed to think aloud placed participants in a state akin to free association, a spontaneous, non-linear process of making connections. This process revealed how participants&rsquo; minds naturally navigated through their own web of references and experiences. As a result, another significant method emerged for how participants classified content: by making associations, which involved directly linking titles with other titles or groups of titles due to their perceived similarities. While both tropes and associations serve as mechanisms for content classification, they operate on different levels of narrative understanding and viewer engagement. Tropes are about identifying specific narrative patterns, whereas associations involve drawing broader connections based on thematic or stylistic parallels to specific titles the user knows. Participants made associations based on information provided to them by the NRS and their own database of references. These associations would naturally come up during the browsing tasks. For example, U8 noticed <em>The</em> <em>Kissing Booth</em>, which she had seen. When I asked what she thought, she said &ldquo;it was fun &hellip; similar to <em>Never Have I Ever</em>, like, same genre &hellip; something of a teenage person&rsquo;s life &hellip; getting into university, both of them same, and then navigating love lives, things like that.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Associations happened most often when participants were looking at thumbnails and previews. I asked U3 why she hovered on <em>The Family Business</em>. &ldquo;That one did catch my eye. It interests me because I feel like it could be a <em>Succession</em> kind of thing.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <div class="thumbnail_img"><img src="images/context/familybiz.png"></div>
                    <p>
                        This hunch is unsurprising given the thumbnail&rsquo;s visual and stylistic cues. The depiction of two adults in suits, engaged in a confrontational stance, coupled with the use of a shallow depth of field and a cool-toned color palette, are distinctive visual elements characteristic of <em>Succession</em>, suggesting a thematic or aesthetic parallel between the two shows.
                    </p>
                    <div class="thumbnail_img"><img src="images/context/youngsheldon.png"></div>
                    <p>
                        While considering <em>Young Sheldon</em>, U5 remarked &ldquo;I guess it brought me in because it gave like <em>The Office</em>;&rdquo; perhaps this was because the title was written in a typewriter font. It is unclear if Netflix is intentionally mimicking the graphic design and stylistic elements of other shows; regardless, these subtle nods were perceptible and effective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other times participants would associate a title with a broader style of television rather than a particular show. The preview of <em>Hack My Home</em> reminded U3 of HGTV; &ldquo;This could be good. I love HGTV. This is a Netflix series, so it&rsquo;s not on HGTV but it seems like that it&rsquo;s that kind of style.&rdquo; Associating <em>Hack My Home</em> with a style of television that she already knew and liked enabled U3 to confidently settle on this as her final choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Associations allow users to make sense of unfamiliar content by connecting it to what they already know or enjoy, illustrating the importance of cultural knowledge in browsing decision-making. Much like tropes, participants were only able to make associations to content they have seen or heard of. By grouping unfamiliar content with familiar categories based on their perceived similarities, participants were able to make sense of new material.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Perceived Audiences</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Netflix users I spoke to also classified content based on who they thought would watch it. In this case, people would ascribe content to particular social categories, namely, age, race, and gender. Take this example of U6 explaining why he was uninterested in some of the titles in the &ldquo;TV Comedies&rdquo; row while browsing the impersonalized homepage:
                        </p>
                    <div class="row_img"><img src="images/context/tvcomediesrow1.png"></div>
                    <blockquote>
                        <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, not my genre, probably for women.
                    </blockquote>  
                    <blockquote>
                        <em>Good Girls</em>, not my genre, probably for women.
                    </blockquote>
                    <div class="row_img"><img src="images/context/tvcomediesrow2.png"></div>
                    <blockquote>
                        Um, <em>Tom and Jerry</em>, literally a cartoon for kids.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        [<em>Scooby Doo</em>] Cartoon for kids.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        [<em>Nicky Ricky Dicky &amp; Dawn</em>] Um, maybe something for like pre-teens or something, this looks like children, Disney show.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        Um, <em>Cobra Kai</em>, I know &hellip; I&rsquo;ve watched this before, it just didn&rsquo;t hook me.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <em>Jane the Virgin</em>. Probably for women, or kids, or having kids, having babies. Not interested.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        U6 did not just say these titles were not for him, he suggested who they might be for. His intuitive judgments draw upon stereotypes related to both the shows themselves and the social categories he assigns to them. For U6 to classify <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, <em>Good Girls</em>, and <em>Jane the Virgin </em>as &ldquo;probably for women,&rdquo; he must tap into a broader understanding of which themes and narratives are traditionally marketed to or associated with female audiences. This implies awareness of the societal norms that dictate certain genres or storylines as being of particular interest to women.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes participants made these classifications based on their personal experience with particular demographic groups. U10 liked history documentaries, so I asked him about <em>Age of Tanks</em>, a documentary about WWI. After hovering over it to watch the preview, he concluded that &ldquo;this is for dads, like, middle-aged white guys that are a little too invested in World War II.&rdquo; This classification was rooted in personal experience, given that U10 said <em>Age of Tanks</em> was &ldquo;something my stepdad would watch&rdquo; and &ldquo;maybe I&rsquo;d watch it with him if it was already on and I was bored.&rdquo; By ascribing certain shows and genres to specific demographic categories, users like U6 and U10 navigate their content consumption choices through the lens of social identity, potentially limiting their exposure to content they deem to belong to another social group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being recommended children&rsquo;s content in the impersonalized environment surprised a few of the participants who did not typically see this on their own homepages. U5 was shocked to see <em>Coco Melon</em> in the trending row, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen that before &hellip; because that&rsquo;s always in the kids one.&rdquo; During one impersonalized browsing task, U3 remarked, &ldquo;not interested. All this stuff looks like it&rsquo;s for kids.&rdquo; U3&rsquo;s discernment of this content as being &ldquo;for kids&rdquo; showcases the application of cultural knowledge in the assessment of age appropriateness. This ability to instantly categorize shows within age-specific domains indicates a sophisticated understanding of the visual and thematic cues that signal content&rsquo;s intended demographic. Rather than merely reflecting on personal preferences, such judgments rely on an extensive backdrop of cultural contexts and industry norms that dictate content marketing for different age groups.

                    <p>
                        Participants classifying content based on who they deemed it was for demonstrates how Netflix users utilize their cultural insights to navigate the vast media landscape, guiding their selections towards what aligns with their identity or away from what is perceived as outside their demographic relevance.
                    </p>
                <h4>Situational Suitability</h4>
                    <p>
                        Beyond simply identifying whether a program is something that they might like, participants also decided whether the program fit their current situation or &ldquo;mood.&rdquo; Participants often encountered content they liked but did not suit the situational prompt I gave them or what they felt like watching at the time. In this case, evaluating content was not a question of &ldquo;is this for me?&rdquo; rather, &ldquo;is this for now?&rdquo; When this happened, participants classified titles based on where or when they deemed it appropriate to watch them. For example, U7 rejected <em>Money Heist </em>because he was not in the mood to get riled up by an action thriller at the end of a workday.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Like I said, I want to relax, right? I don&rsquo;t want to keep stuck on my toes because of an accident and stuff. So I don&rsquo;t want to watch that. I&rsquo;d rather go for one that makes me relax and smile&hellip;
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Because of his previous exposure to action thrillers, U7 knew that watching <em>Money Heist </em>would be a high-energy viewing experience. His discernment highlights the fact that users engage with Netflix not merely for entertainment but as a tool for managing their emotional states, seeking content that aligns with their immediate psychological needs. Some participants expressed that they did not like watching particular forms of content alone. U2 said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really like watching reality TV by myself&rdquo; and U1 said &ldquo;movies I can only ever watch with other people.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most participants expressed that sometimes they liked to watch things passively while folding laundry, unloading the dishwasher, or doing other tasks. When I asked U3 whether she liked to multitask while watching TV, she said it depends on the show.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        For something like <em>Suits</em>, yes. For something like <em>Fall of the House of Usher</em>, no &hellip; because that&rsquo;s one where I&rsquo;m watching for the story &hellip; I actually care about what's happening &hellip; It&rsquo;s really about whether or not I feel like I have to pay attention.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Attention and time were often cited as constraints while choosing content. <em>Nyad</em> had been on U3&rsquo;s list of movies to watch since her girlfriend recommended it. However, for the first browsing task, she was asked to find something she was in the mood for, and she did not want to watch a movie. &ldquo;Too long &hellip; otherwise I would have chosen that.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were numerous cases of participants desiring to watch a title outside the context of their browsing task. U5 was prompted to find something to put on in the background. He initially shrugged off <em>Pablo Escobar</em>, but after seriously considering it for a minute&mdash;explaining how he believed Pablo Escobar is one of the lesser discussed narcos and the possible reasons why&mdash;he admitted, &ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m too into it now. I feel like I wouldn&rsquo;t play that in the background &hellip; Like, I&rsquo;d want to watch it, watch it.&rdquo; The distinction between wanting to &ldquo;watch it watch it&rdquo; versus a more passive form of consumption was something alluded to by other participants. U4 would watch <em>Scarface</em>, but not casually. &ldquo;It is something I would watch on a plane though.&rdquo; For her, finding something to watch passively was difficult because it forced her to sacrifice on standards.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        The hard part is, I need a show that is like a B rating in my mind because I can tune out, and it won&rsquo;t matter. But it&rsquo;s so hard because I have pretty extreme opinions.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Of course, determining what a B rating is requires cinematic taste, which encompasses the user&rsquo;s understanding of genre conventions, narrative complexities, and thematic nuances. This balancing act requires selecting content that is sufficiently engaging to hold interest without demanding full cognitive engagement, allowing viewers to enjoy it without the need for intense focus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The context-dependence of viewing preferences poses an obvious challenge for the NRS: recommending the correct program not only requires knowing the user&rsquo;s preferences, but also their mood at that moment. This is one reason why the user must collaborate with the NRS to identify the right show for the occasion. Users often select shows or movies aligned with their immediate feelings or the specific context of their viewing, adopting a discerning method for choosing content that suits the present moment rather than just their general preferences. Viewing habits are influenced by the desire for passive consumption, indicating that not all viewing is active or requires full attention. And there is a conscious negotiation between wanting to be fully engaged with content versus selecting something that allows for multitasking, reflecting a context-specific balancing act while browsing. Participants classifying content based on their ideal viewing situation demonstrated their awareness that sometimes the best choice in theory was not always optimal in practice.
                    </p>
                <h4>Social and Moral Acceptability</h4>
                    <p>
                        Some choices are more contentious than others. Within a particular cultural context some shows are deemed acceptable or appropriate to watch while others are not. The social and moral acceptability of a film depends on its viewing context and the background and values of the audience. U7 explained that some of his selections are based on his culture experience as a Nigerian immigrant &ldquo;and how I negotiate that contestation between where I&rsquo;m from and where I am now and what is socially acceptable here.&rdquo; He spotted <em>Woman King</em>, a movie he already watched and liked, which led him to explain some of the considerations he makes while selecting content.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        In Nigerian movies, before now, they moderate certain contents because of its social acceptability, so um, gender kind of movies were not really made in Nigeria because, of course, it's a highly patriarchal society. So, you won&rsquo;t really find movies like <em>Woman King</em> trending in Nigeria. But because I have that interest in international norms &hellip; movies like this would appeal to me, regardless of the fact that I&rsquo;m coming from a patriarchal society where those things are not. These are some of the, um, should I say, silent conversations I have within me while I&rsquo;m thinking of what movies to watch &hellip; but again, I don&rsquo;t want to watch movies that are extreme because I also want to be able to have conversations about them and feel comfortable having those conversations with my friends, especially with my family and my wife.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Media consumption is a site of cultural contestation, and this is particularly pronounced for individuals in diaspora. Being able to comfortably talk about what he watches with his family was important to U7, demonstrating that movies and TV shows are not just personal entertainment, they are also mediums through which social relationships are maintained and cultural values are negotiated and transmitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other users were conscientious of the political impact of their consumption habits. U4 noticed <em>SWAT</em> by recognizing Shemar Moore but decided not to watch it because she did not want to glorify the police.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        Wait, is this the guy who&rsquo;s in <em>Criminal Minds</em>? &hellip; I love that man, so much &hellip; But the hard part is, too, I want to be, at least semi culturally conscious when I'm picking police-themed TV shows, because I&rsquo;m like, am I glorifying the profession by watching it?
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        While she deemed SWAT socially unacceptable because &ldquo;it felt too pro police,&rdquo; other users were unbothered or did not consider this altogether. Two other participants chose <em>SWAT</em> as their final selection for their browsing tasks. This discrepancy suggests that while some content is fine to particular social groups, others may deem it unacceptable based on their political beliefs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were also instances where content did not align with users&rsquo; morals. While browsing romance reality, I asked U9 what she thought of <em>Down for Love</em>, a Netflix original series that follows adolescents with Down syndrome while trying to navigate the complicated world of dating.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        That one I&rsquo;m not so sure about. I&rsquo;ve seen the other one, <em>Love on the Spectrum</em>, and it made me feel kinda weird.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        [Interviewer: Why?]
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        I don&rsquo;t know. Something about it isn&rsquo;t right. It treads this odd line where it&rsquo;s like, on one hand, the show will be very heartwarming and hopeful and like, human and kind. But then it will also try to be funny and entertaining and will make fun of their autism. It feels predatory &hellip; I have very complicated feelings towards that show, and this feels very similar to that, so no.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        U9&rsquo;s discomfort, characterized by the perceived exploitation of the show&rsquo;s participants for entertainment, reveals the moral ambiguity of certain content choices. This instance diverges from social acceptability in that it is not just about societal standards but requires the participant to take moral inventory and judge whether content aligns with their personal values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Observing this phenomenon was difficult given it is a socially undesirable case. People are uncomfortable talking about why they or others deem certain content taboo. As U7 said, these are the &ldquo;silent conversations&rdquo; he has inside his head. However, the testimonies of U4, U7, and U9 suggest that social and moral acceptability is a consideration Netflix users make while determining what to watch. Classifying content based on whether it aligns with personal and community values highlights how viewers&rsquo; choices are deeply influenced by their cultural backgrounds, personal beliefs, and the broader societal and political implications of their media consumption. These considerations, similar to the audience-related concerns raised by the non-clickers from Ellison&rsquo;s study, affirm that media selection is a complex negotiation, reflecting the interplay between individual viewer identities and the cultural and social contexts in which they exist.

            <h3>Browsing Behavior: Process, Strategy, and Platform Affordances</h3>
            <div class="subsection">
                    <p>
                        Having explored how participants navigate the Netflix homepage, employing cultural knowledge to classify content, our investigation naturally progresses from the individual&rsquo;s thought processes to their interactions with the mechanisms that shape and guide these experiences. The browsing experience on Netflix is a dynamic, non-linear process described by iterative funneling, a theoretical model I propose that categorizes user interaction into four distinct phases: search, discovery, evaluation, and selection. With this model in mind, I discuss some of the browsing strategies used by the participants I interviewed; most of these tactics either narrowed search criteria or were information-seeking behaviors aimed at helping the user evaluate content. Some users&rsquo; strategic navigation and evaluation of content demonstrate an active negotiation with algorithmic suggestions, revealing a complex interplay between user agency, algorithmic mediation, and cultural knowledge in the content selection process.
                    </p>
                <h4>Iterative Funneling: A Speculative Model of the Browsing Process</h4>
                    <p>
                        This section will propose a model to describe and delineate the browsing process as it is experienced by users, who are channeled by the platform into particular paths of action. This model arose out of patterns in my data and observations. However, the claims I suggest about the cognition involved in browsing cannot be proven with interview data&mdash;as Vaisey notes, the semi-structured interview &ldquo;puts us in direct contact with discursive consciousness but gives us little leverage on unconscious cognitive processes&rdquo; (Vaisey 2009 1688)&mdash;so these claims are purely speculative. I present them to suggest that researchers within psychology and neuroscience could continue investigating the types of thinking involved in browsing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Picture a funnel: on one end lies every option (in our case, the entire Netflix library), and on the other, one final choice. As the user moves through the funnel, they make dozens of tiny decisions&mdash;where to look, which rows to scroll through, how many, whether to hover on a title to watch its preview or not&mdash;often subconsciously, often half-heartedly, often backtracking and changing their mind.
                    </p>
                    <div class="funnel-diagram">
                        <div id="process-steps">
                            <img src="images/diagrams/sdes.png" alt="Process Steps">

                        <div id="funnel-container"></div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Every browsing session begins with a search. Most of the time, participants started by glossing through the homepage, but in a few cases, participants immediately narrowed the search criteria by looking for specific titles, genres, or formats. At this point, participants wandered, somewhat aimlessly, waiting for something to hook them. During this search phase, participants made snap judgments about content based on their thumbnails (e.g. U6 quickly dismissed titles as &ldquo;not my genre&rdquo;), often without conscious deliberation or reasoning. The images the user encounters in the first phase are not enough information to decide whether they want to watch it, but they are enough to determine whether they want to pursue it further. When something eventually caught their eye, participants would &ldquo;discover&rdquo; it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A multitude of factors led to discovery: previous exposure (e.g. U4 recognized Shemar Moore in <em>SWAT</em>), visual cues embedded in thumbnail (U3 was drawn to <em>The Family Business </em>because it reminded her of <em>Succession</em>), and its relative position on the homepage. Despite being instructed to think aloud, participants did much of this early navigational work silently, instinctually, automatically, and without direction. This observation leads me to suggest that during search and discovery&mdash;the shallow mode of browsing&mdash;participants embodied a more practical consciousness. Since they could not realistically examine every option presented to them with a fine-toothed comb, they relied on &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo; inferences to make decisions efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I tried probing decisions made during these phases, participants were often frustrated or at a loss for words, since I was essentially asking them to verbalize internalized schemas that seemed obvious to them. For instance, I asked U10 why he ignored <em>3 Body Problem</em>, which was the marquee image on his homepage. He said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Seems boring.&rdquo; When I asked why, he flipped the question back on me. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, why does anything seem boring? It just does. I don&rsquo;t have a reason.&rdquo; Oftentimes when I asked participants these sorts of questions, they would provide rationale. I asked U4 why she clicked on the thumbnail for <em>Blue Zones</em>. She said, &ldquo;the reason I was drawn to it was because they had a very bright color and I like their different fonts.&rdquo; However, &ldquo;discursive consciousness is incredibly good at offering reasons that may not be at all related to the real motives behind a person&rsquo;s behavior&rdquo; (Vaisey 2009 1688).

                    <p>
                        While participants began by doing a rapid pass over a wide swath of options, they switched techniques as they narrowed in on individual titles. During the early phases of browsing, participants were guided by interest and intrigue, but once they had singled-out a particular title, their actions became deliberate information-seeking behaviors guided by specific questions like, &ldquo;how many seasons does this have?&rdquo; (U2), &ldquo;is this in German?&rdquo; (U1), and &ldquo;when was this made?&rdquo; (U10). To seek out the additional information necessary to evaluate content, participants watched previews, read synopses, and examined the evidence provided to them by the NRS with the aim of finding something that would persuade or dissuade them from watching.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When evaluating a single title, participants were able to point to specific details that turned them on or off. For instance, U1 was originally drawn to Manifest because he likes planes. Judging from the thumbnail, he thought &ldquo;it was gonna be like, plane mystery investigations, or maybe a docufiction about this hijacking, or maybe even something about the history of the commercial aviation industry.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <div class="thumbnail_img">

                    <p>
                        However, he was disappointed when he read the show&rsquo;s description and learned this was not the case.
                    </p>
                    <div class="description_img">

                    <blockquote>
                        That whole gimmick, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve disappeared,&rdquo; even the <em>Avengers</em> has done that. And also, the fuck? The plot? That makes no sense from the get-go? A plane is flying mysteriously for years and then lands and everybody&rsquo;s lives messed up because they&rsquo;ve been gone for years&hellip; You're asking a lot from your audience within the first sentence of your bio. Fuck physics, fuck time &hellip; Yeah, I was just there for the planes.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Many cases of misalignment like this occurred, where there was a discrepancy between participants&rsquo; first impressions and what the content was actually about. When this happened, participants had specific rationale and information to justify their choices. Because these considerations were explicit and articulable, I would suggest that during the latter phases of browsing, participants embodied a more discursive consciousness. After completing what the participant deemed to be an exhaustive search, they would come to a final selection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A single browsing session can be broken down into these four distinct phases: search, discovery, evaluation, and selection. As this iterative process unfolds, the user makes increasingly granular and deliberate judgements, oscillating between the realm of practical to discursive consciousness. The five classification systems I outlined in the first section do not directly correspond to the four phases of iterative funneling, they were used by participants throughout the entire browsing process as filters to understand unfamiliar content and disqualify potential candidates. For instance, U6 identified a trope while looking at the thumbnail of <em>Hunter Killer </em>(discovery phase) and U4 did so while scrutinizing episode descriptions of <em>Cold Case Files</em> (evaluation phase). &nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The iterative funneling model is useful because it delineates the process of browsing into concrete phases while accounting for back-and-forth navigational behaviors. The model also provides a framework for comparing user behaviors across different digital platforms or within different browsing contexts. By applying the model to various scenarios, researchers can explore how platform affordances, content types, and user goals influence browsing behavior. Following Vaisey&rsquo;s dual model of culture in action, I would suggest that in the early phases of browsing (search and discovery), cultural knowledge primarily operates through practical consciousness as a motivational force guiding users implicitly; at the latter end (evaluation and selection), it shifts towards discursive consciousness, serving as a justification for the choices made.

                    <h5>Settling</h5>
                        <p>
                            Many participants experienced browsing as a process of settling&mdash;reaching the point at which they decide to stop searching and opt to watch a show or movie despite it not their your first choice. This primarily served as a method to achieve satisfactory content choices under limited time constraints. Most settlers experienced something in line with a phenomenon described by U1: &ldquo;I see something I half recognized. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind watching it. Let&rsquo;s see. But I&rsquo;m not totally convinced by it, so I keep scrolling, and then everything else disappoints me.&rdquo; The most common tactic employed by settlers was having backup options. The way this worked was while browsing, participants would flag items to potentially return to. At the top of the page, U7 was recommended <em>The Flash</em>, which had been on his radar for a while.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            What I do when I see a recommendation like this is to see if there&rsquo;s any other one that is more interesting than it. If not, then I come back to it.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            After browsing for a few minutes, U7 ended up selecting <em>The Flash</em>. As U3 explained, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nice to have the fallback because if it&rsquo;s been like a minute and I haven&rsquo;t found something else, I&rsquo;m just gonna be like, ugh, fine. It&rsquo;s a lot of that.&rdquo; Some users alluded to there being a hierarchy of backup options. When I asked about <em>Leave the World Behind</em>, U6 said &ldquo;that would be like a back pocket.&rdquo; He moused over <em>Bad Surgeon</em>. &ldquo;This is like back back pocket.&rdquo; The strategy of settling demonstrates an awareness that rarely users are going to find the perfect movie or show, most of the time they are looking for the next best thing.

                <h4>Proactive Engagement: Platform Affordances and Browsing Strategies</h4>
                    <p>
                        The architecture of the Netflix homepage is central to understanding how the NRS mediates the browsing process and how participants used features of the platform to facilitate their search, discovery, evaluation, and selection of content. While most participants relied on the NRS to provide them with adequate recommendations on their homepage, more savvy Netflix users will leverage the platform&rsquo;s affordances to extract the information they deem most useful to evaluate content. Most of the browsing strategies I observed were aimed at narrowing search criteria and sourcing additional information to aid evaluation.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Narrowing Search Criteria</h5>
                        <p>
                            While the majority of participants&rsquo; search was contained within the homepage, some participants employed browsing strategies&mdash;namely using the &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; search feature and filtering by microtags and generic categories&mdash;aimed at narrowing the scope of their search. Users effectively reduced the amount of work they would have to do during the initial search phase of browsing. The majority of participants stayed exclusively on the homepage while they browsed. Of these users, some explored only the first few rows on the page and would usually decide on something to watch within two to five minutes. For these users, the ranking and sorting of the NRS significantly impacted their navigation through and selection of content because naturally, users would gravitate towards what they saw first. U4 explained how the NRS&rsquo; ranking and sorting guided her to navigate to somewhat arbitrary places out of convenience.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            The earlier up it is in these rows, the more I&rsquo;m drawn to it &hellip; like, &ldquo;Familiar TV Favorites.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t have a reason to really be picking at this selection&hellip; I went there because it was the first thing.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            In a similar vein, U3 assumed content depreciated in quality as the search went on.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            I also always find that whatever they&rsquo;re showing you first, is always better than whatever comes next &hellip; the first 6 clips I always think are better than whatever the next 24 are &hellip; So it is pretty rare that I&rsquo;ll really scroll through the categories.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Here, she is making implicit assumptions about quality based on the show&rsquo;s positioning on the page, which is determined by the ranking and sorting algorithms of the NRS. Though, these assumptions are not unfounded. Netflix&rsquo;s behavioral research indicated that users are more likely to scan vertically than horizontally (Alvino and Basilico 2015), therefore, content the NRS deems most promising is placed towards the top left of the page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To go beyond homepage recommendations, participants employed filtering tactics to narrow the criteria of their search. One of the most common strategies was participants searching for titles that were not on the platform to see algorithmically generated recommendations of similar content. As U1 explained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put a title of a movie that I know is not on Netflix, but they do the thing where they find similar things to it.&rdquo; Four participants said they have done this before and three of them did it during the interview. U4 explained that in order to use this feature to find shows like <em>Criminal Minds</em>, she would start by looking at all the shows Netflix &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; are similar and &ldquo;find the one that like, has the right qualifications for why I liked <em>Criminal Minds</em>.&rdquo; Her approach reveals an essential layer of human judgment required within the interaction with the NRS. While the algorithm provides a list of ostensibly similar shows, the crucial task of discerning which of these recommendations aligns with the specific reasons she appreciated <em>Criminal Minds</em> falls squarely on her. Searching for &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; titles enabled participants to leverage the NRS&rsquo; advanced categorization capabilities&mdash;as of 2014, Netflix had 76,897 altgenres (Madrigal 2014)&mdash;while controlling the input keywords to generate more tailored results. This tactic allowed participants to exercise agency within a system that does not grant much. However, the &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; search feature was not without its limitations. U4 explained that sometimes she felt like &ldquo;the Netflix selection in &lsquo;shows like this&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t that good.&rdquo; She was confused why they listed some shows as like the one she was looking for; &ldquo;like maybe it&rsquo;s just the same director but it&rsquo;s something completely different.&rdquo; When the NRS&rsquo;s &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; recommendations failed to align with the reasons why she liked a particular show, she would turn to Google.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When participants decided to browse by genetic category or microtag, it was because they had something specific in mind, like if they wanted to watch a particular genre, in a particular language, or a TV show instead of a movie. Two participants with more technical literacy and familiarity with the Netflix platform used microtags to help them browse. U2 employed the most intricate and sophisticated browsing strategies of any user I spoke to. During two of her browsing tasks, she utilized micro tags to help her browse, looking through tags entitled &ldquo;Romantic,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reality TV,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Columbian.&rdquo;
                        </p>
                        <div class="screenshot">
                            <img src="images/context/colombianmicrotags.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            She explained that she was looking at the Columbian tag &ldquo;because I don't watch enough stuff in Spanish and I prefer Colombian Spanish, obviously.&rdquo; But she had to parse through these options since &ldquo;so many of them are about narco trafficking, which I&rsquo;m not into.&rdquo;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some participants said time constraints limited their ability to browse as thoroughly as they would like. For instance, U8 has browsed using microtags in the past, saying, &ldquo;I used to be very picky, I used to take a lot of time to find what I wanted to watch,&rdquo; but now she is under stricter time constraints while pursuing her master&rsquo;s degree so &ldquo;I just put on something because, you know, I have to eat and then get stuff done later, so.&rdquo; Deeper browsing requires time and persistence, because of this many participants relied heavily on the NRS and experienced browsing as a process of settling.
                        </p>
                    <h5>Sourcing Additional Information</h5>
                        <p>
                            Sourcing additional information beyond the thumbnail was necessary for participants to make selections. Participants explored further details by watching previews, reading descriptions, and reviewing the various pieces of evidence provided by the NRS. None of the users I spoke to were able to make a selection without doing some research. While the extent of this research varied, it was always a crucial step necessary to evaluate content. Most of this research happened within the Netflix platform with participants relying on information provided by the NRS. Most of these techniques have been detailed or alluded to in previous sections of this paper, such as hovering over a thumbnail to watch a preview, clicking on it to expand its details, and reading descriptive adjectives and synopses. With each successive action, participants had access to more information (see fig. 3.2).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In rare cases, some participants would conduct research outside of Netflix on the internet. For instance, U2 was interested in <em>Surviving Summer</em>, an Australian drama about a group of teenagers who surf. She watched the trailer on Netflix but needed to know more, so she googled &ldquo;surviving summer&rdquo; and clicked on its IMDB page.
                        </p>
                        <div class="screenshot">
                            <img src="images/context/survivingsummer.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            During the browsing task review, she explained what she was looking for.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            I wanted to know who Ari is. Because there was a guy with a girlfriend that she seemed kind of mad that he had a girlfriend, like the main character. So I was wondering if that was the guy that she was like, interested in, surfing-wise, and I think it was.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            In this scenario, U2 was using the internet to learn more about specific character dynamics. Other times, participants used the internet to find spoilers. U4 was considering <em>Hellbound</em>, a Korean drama about a cult-like entity founded on the idea of religious justice. She said she might watch it but &ldquo;would have to honestly look online and also see the reviews&rdquo; first. She googled &ldquo;hellbound&rdquo; and clicked on its Wikipedia page. She scanned the first two paragraphs and scrolled towards the bottom of the page.
                        </p>
                        <div class="screenshot">
                            <img src="images/context/hellboundwiki.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            I asked what information she was looking for. She said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking to make sure that the religious group has, like, a horrible downfall.&rdquo; Once she confirmed this, U4 selected <em>Hellbound</em> as her final choice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Participants invariably sought out more information beyond the initial presentation of content on Netflix to make informed decisions about what to watch. They did this by utilizing features within Netflix, such as hovering over a thumbnail or clicking on it to see the expanded details to access more information about content. This reliance on the platform&rsquo;s built-in tools underscores the importance of these features in aiding users&rsquo; decision-making processes. This highlights that the initial algorithmic recommendations and visual cues provided by thumbnails are starting points rather than endpoints in the content selection process. Some users, particularly those with specific interests or questions, went beyond Netflix to conduct external research. This was done to gather detailed information about character dynamics, plot specifics, or to find reviews and spoilers that are not available within the Netflix platform.

            <h3>Working Together: The User and the NRS</h3>
            <div class="subsection">  
                <p>
                    Users engage with the system, leveraging its recommendations to refine their search, but also contribute actively by classifying content, employing browsing strategies, and sometimes trying to &ldquo;game&rdquo; the NRS for more relevant suggestions. Many participants spoke about browsing as being a collaborative effort between them and the NRS. Some users liked to do this work more than others. U3 found it tedious. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t like to browse. I want to just start watching the show. This is like work, and I don&rsquo;t want to do work.&rdquo; This made her more comfortable with settling. On the other hand, users like U2 and U4 conducted extremely thorough searches by using micro-tags, the &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; search feature, and by close-reading episode descriptions. U2 believed she puts in more work than the NRS, and moreover, that she games the system:
                </p>  
                <blockquote>
                    I think I work it more than it works me &hellip; I think I take what it gives me and maximize it, rather than them laying it all out for me &hellip; It shows me a lot of options of similar content that I&rsquo;ve watched. But like, I think I do the hard work of going through all of that to see something that is actually similar to what I watched and not like, different. Well, I think it does very basic level curation, but I don&rsquo;t think it actually can predict what I like.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The perspective offered by U2 suggests a dissonance between the system&rsquo;s intended functionality of delivering highly personalized content and the reality that for some especially picky users, it fails to deliver fully on this promise. This sentiment, &ldquo;I think I work it more than it works me,&rdquo; reveals strategic engagement with the platform, where the user assumes a more proactive role in navigating the options presented by the NRS, rather than relying on the system&rsquo;s automated curation. Despite her characterization of browsing as labor, U3 recognized the necessity of her participation in the search process, saying &ldquo;I guess I just don&rsquo;t really expect it to be giving me the good stuff. I expect to be finding it.&rdquo; Participants recognized that relying on algorithmically generated recommendations could bring them close, but only so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the interview, I asked participants to compare their experience browsing the personalized and impersonalized environments. Most participants found it easier to browse their own homepage and found personalization to be generally helpful. U3 said &ldquo;I think mine kind of jumps into genres pretty quickly. And here you get genres, but they&rsquo;re way less specific.&rdquo; U8 noticed in the default profile &ldquo;there are no Indian movies,&rdquo; compared to her homepage which had many. It is clear that the NRS does not merely curate content; it approximates and adapts to the habitus of its users. When asked to describe the process of browsing Netflix, U6 compared it to finding a culturally specific grocery store:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    It&rsquo;s like going to a grocery store in your neighborhood even like arguably to your culture. So let&rsquo;s say like for me if I was to go to a Mexican grocery store. It kind of knows what you want to a certain extent, right? This is foods in your culture. It&rsquo;s gonna have things you like. It&rsquo;s gonna piece them together a little bit. Whereas if I was making a Mexican meal and I went to Whole Foods, it&rsquo;s gonna be a lot harder, right? Whole Foods is gonna be a little bit more generic. Whole Foods is gonna have the end-all be-all for everyone. And like, you&rsquo;ll get close enough, right? You&rsquo;ll find something, of course. It&rsquo;ll be good &hellip; But um, as you navigate the system, you start to find your grocery store.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This analogy was apt, I would only ask, are people really &ldquo;finding their grocery store&rdquo; or is Whole Foods changing the items on the shelves? In this metaphor, U6 is recognizing that the NRS intuits information about his cultural taste and caters to those tastes. By using data to intuit user&rsquo;s backgrounds, habits, and cultural context, the NRS attempts to approximate the habitus of its users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users engage with the NRS in varied ways, from passive acceptance of recommendations to active searching and manipulation of the system to find content that aligns more closely with their preferences. This suggests a spectrum of reliance on the NRS, where some users&rsquo; interactions are characterized by proactive engagement, while others would rather leave the burden of choice to the NRS. Discussions around personalized and impersonalized browsing experiences reveals the importance of cultural specificity in content recommendation. Users like U8 noted a stark difference in the availability of culturally relevant content between personalized and default profiles, underscoring the NRS&rsquo;s capacity to adapt to users&rsquo; cultural backgrounds and tastes.

                        Although the NRS offers highly personalized recommendations, these are seldom enough for users to identify the movies or shows that truly capture their interest, necessitating further exploration, information-seeking, and scrutiny to determine if the content aligns with their preferences. Participants employed a sophisticated classification system based on cultural knowledge to navigate Netflix. This involved identifying tropes, making associations, ascribing perceived audiences, gauging situational suitability, and determining the social and moral acceptability of content. The iterative funneling model describes browsing as a dynamic process of search, discovery, evaluation, and selection, where users oscillate between instinctual action and deliberate decision-making depending on the depth of their browse. The choice architecture of the Netflix homepage plays a crucial role in shaping user browsing behavior. Users leverage platform affordances to narrow search criteria and find content that aligns with their tastes. Overall, browsing Netflix is a collaboration between the user and the platform&rsquo;s recommendation system, where strategic user engagement and algorithmic suggestions converge to guide the discovery and selection of content.

                <h5>Limitations</h5>
                    <p>
                        Because of this study&rsquo;s limited scope and small sample size, these findings are not meant to describe patterns in the behavior and experiences of the entire Netflix userbase. Rather, this investigation serves as an exploratory study to suggest how sociologists may integrate methods from HCI to study the cultural exercise of browsing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Algorithms and the platforms they coordinate are dynamic entities. A static portrait of Netflix would be an inaccurate one. Over the seven months I collected data, I watched as titles flowed in and out of the &ldquo;Top 10&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trending Now&rdquo; rows and new features were released on the platform. Participants never had identical experiences browsing the homepage, part of this was by design, part of this was a consequence of the duration of the study.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the default condition was an imperfect approximation, it served mainly to contrast the personalized profile. Even without a viewing history, the NRS does not start from scratch. Netflix utilizes account-linked information, such as device type and zip code, to provide initial recommendations. To ensure tabula rasa, I cleared the default profile&rsquo;s viewing history after each interview. Despite the influence of personalization being one of the questions motivating the experimental design of this study, I did not observe significant differences in behavior and strategy when participants browsed the personalized verses the impersonalized environment.
                    </p>
                <h5>Significance</h5>
                    <p>
                        The technology developed and used by Netflix actuates the predictive marketing dream of delivering of hyper-personalized cultural experiences on a global scale. Recommendation systems are not going anywhere. As they increase in ubiquity and capability, their innerworkings, usage, and effects should be scrutinized and better understood. This research presents a novel integration of sociological models of culture and cognition with HCI methodologies to study the process of browsing. My findings emphasize how human expertise and cultural knowledge are instrumental to content selection, challenging the narrative that users are passive recipients of algorithmic recommendations. The strategies users deploy to navigate the vast content offerings of Netflix reflect broader societal trends of adapting to information overload in the digital age. This adaptation includes developing personalized mechanisms for filtering, evaluating, and selecting content, a form of digital literacy.
                    </p>
                <h5>Avenues for Future Research</h5>
                    <p>
                        Browsing is worthy of further exploration across all fields, but especially the social sciences that have traditionally overlooked this deeply cultural exercise. Curated content feeds offer an exciting new frontier for researchers to probe the symbolic representations people use to make sense of the world. There are so many avenues for future research on browsing. Similar studies could be replicated on other streaming or social media platforms. One direction I find particularly fascinating as a student of sociology is exploring how people navigate dating apps, because there, users are making decisions about prospective partners, not merely content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given that browsing involves both practical and discursive modes of culture and cognition, I think it presents an opportunity to empirically investigate Vaisey&rsquo;s dual model. In this paper, the claims I make about the two types of cognition involved in browsing are purely speculative. To confidently assert these claims, it would be necessary to utilize neuroimaging data, using techniques like fNIRS or EEG, which can pinpoint localized brain activity during various phases of browsing.

                        Algorithms are not ethereal. They are created by humans and operate within the earthly realm. The perceived opacity of algorithms reinforces the belief that they are &ldquo;black boxes,&rdquo; inscrutable unless analyzed on the level of machine code. Black box critiques have also been levied against Bourdieu&rsquo;s notion of habitus (e.g. Boudon 1998; King 2000), claiming that it does not adequately account for individual agency and is difficult to operationalize in empirical research. This study sought to demonstrate that when culture and algorithms are examined in tandem, they can elucidate each other.

                    I would like to express my gratitude the people who made this research possible. I must first thank Austin Kozlowski, my preceptor, who provided invaluable insights, direction, and guidance throughout the entire genesis and production of this thesis. Karin Knorr Cetina&rsquo;s support as my advisor provided a foundation upon which this work could flourish. Alessandra Lembo exposed me to research within the sociology of culture and cognition, enriching my thesis with a breadth of literature. Jon Satrom, through leading the MAAD capstone and contributing to the website&rsquo;s design, helped me to visually articulate my findings. And the camaraderie and shared growth within the Sociology BA seminar offered a sense of community, making the arduous journey of thesis development a collective triumph.
