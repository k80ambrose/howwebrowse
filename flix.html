For example, if a participant mentioned they often watch Netflix while doing chores, I would ask them to find something to watch while folding laundry. This task was designed to simulate a real-life scenario that influences their content selection process.

            <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>
                    When Netflix users encounter the homepage, they are met with a deluge of information. How they make sense of it all—turning inferences into distinctions into selections—was the subject of this study. My investigation was primarily motivated by two research questions:
                </p>
                <p class="indented-text">
                    RQ1: How do Netflix users employ cultural knowledge while browsing?<br>
                    RQ2: How is this process mediated through and facilitated by the NRS?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found that participants employed cultural knowledge in their browsing process by classifying content to make sense of an overwhelming abundance of choices. This classification system involved participants identifying tropes, making associations, gauging the situational suitability and the social and moral acceptability of a title, and ascribing content perceived audiences. Content classification is crucial to how the Netflix users I spoke to decided what to watch. The dynamic interaction between the user and the NRS is a collaborative yet complex relationship. Users actively navigate, refine, and sometimes manipulate the system to find content that aligns with their preferences, suggesting a proactive approach to content discovery. Despite the NRS’s intent to personalize effectively, there is a noted gap between its algorithmic suggestions and the nuanced tastes of users, particularly those who are more discerning.
                </p>
            <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Classifying Content</h3>
                <p>
                    The NRS automatically presents recommendations to users based on generic categories. These categories are often already highly specific, like “Revenge Action Thrillers” or “TV Dramedies Featuring a Strong Female Lead,” but rarely are these genres fine-grained enough to identify movies or shows that the user is actually interested in. To move beyond the initial filtering of the Netflix algorithm, users employ a filtering system of their own by classifying content along a variety of valences to simplify the information presented to them on the homepage. These techniques are numerous, but I describe five that were particularly prevalent in my interviews: identifying tropes, making associations, gauging the situational suitability and social and moral acceptability of a title, and ascribing content perceived audiences.

                <h4>Tropes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Netflix users I spoke to classified content using their knowledge of tropes: themes, motifs, and clich&eacute;s embedded in a show or movie&rsquo;s plot. This process involved the participant identifying a piece of information from a thumbnail, preview, or description and recognizing a trope based on that. Genres serve as broad categorizations of media, characterized by shared conventions, settings, themes, and narrative structures. Tropes, on the other hand, become recognizable through their repeated use across various media texts. While genres categorize the overarching framework of narratives, tropes delve into specifics, detailing how stories within these broad categories differentiate themselves. While browsing, tropes functioned as a narrative shorthand, enabling participants to infer a film&rsquo;s plot without actually watching it. By recognizing Gerard Butler from the thumbnail, U6 quickly pegged <em>Hunter Killer</em> as one of those movies where a &ldquo;retired CIA guy gets called back to action.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <div class="thumbnail_img"><img src="images/context/hunterkiller.jpg"></div>
                    <blockquote>
                        I know this guy. This seems kind of cool. Top ten. I might watch. Seems kind of a little bit, um, bro-y, action, whatever. So it might be a little too basic … classic, like, missel military guy, action, uh, save the world … Gerard Butler, like that’s classic him … You know, retired CIA guy gets called back to action because he’s the only one who can do it!  … I guarantee you there’s a dozen movies with him where he’s the military guy saving the day and it’s like, okay been there done that.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This classification led U6 to deem the movie as maybe something he would watch &ldquo;if I&rsquo;m doing laundry or something&rdquo; but not compelling enough to dedicate his full attention due to its perceived lack of originality and narrative depth. U6&rsquo;s discernment, bored by the redundancy of the trope yet still considering the movie for casual watching, {was made possible} by combining the information he was picking up on from the thumbnail with his knowledge of other films where a &ldquo;retired CIA guy gets called back to action.&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Participants also used tropes to distinguish between what they did and didn&rsquo;t like within a specific subgenre. U2 liked romance reality, so I asked, &ldquo;what about <em>Love Island</em>?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;the ones where they&rsquo;re wearing bikinis and have like a fanny pack with the team-building exercises are just not my thing.&rdquo; However, she did like romance reality that used some sort of technology to mediate the interactions between the contestants&mdash;things like <em>The Circle</em> and <em>Too Hot to Handle</em>&mdash;and ended up selecting <em>Deep Fake Love</em>. Because U2 has a nuanced understanding of the thematic and aesthetic elements of the romance reality genre, she was able to pick up on subtle variations between shows to make more informed decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users&rsquo; tendency to seek out tropes to evaluate content extended to episode-level information. U4 cared a lot about what happens during episodes of <em>Cold Case Files </em>and would cherry-pick them based on their plot.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        I am very particular about the kind of unsolved mystery or cold case they&rsquo;re dealing with &hellip; The ones where it&rsquo;s like, you can kinda tell it's a suicide and the family can't accept it is too depressing for me.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        She even recognized language within an episode description that suggested a resolution, saying &ldquo;this one implies that there is an ending to it to it because &lsquo;unraveling a dark family secret.&rsquo;&rdquo;
                    </p>
                    <div class="description_img"><img src="images/context/altoona.png"></div>
                    <p>
                        U4&rsquo;s browsing behavior&mdash;parsing through episodes descriptions looking for tropes&mdash;is in part driven by her knowledge of these tropes and her preferences for some over others. This user is not merely interested in murder mysteries, she specifically wants the murder mysteries where it&rsquo;s obvious there was a murder, and it will be resolved. And because she&rsquo;s seen so many murder mysteries, she knows what she likes, what information to look for, and where to find it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But tropes and the narrative elements they suggested weren&rsquo;t always as crucial to participants. U1, who also enjoys television about crime, seemed to care a lot less about their plot and would put them on as background noise. In fact, he experienced a formulaic plot as an asset, citing his relationship with <em>Criminal Minds</em>.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        I don&rsquo;t really care about, you know, the greater plot, if fucking Spencer Reed is gonna get his girlfriend or not. I&rsquo;m just there for the skit, the routine. What is it? It opens up. Some guy&rsquo;s getting fucking murdered. Where is he? Who is he? The team flies out. I like that repetitiveness, that&rsquo;s why my number one genre on Netflix is probably crime.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        U4&rsquo;s meticulous selection process, driven by her desire for particular plot outcomes and her ability to discern narrative cues from episode descriptions, highlights how specific tropes can significantly impact viewer choice. Conversely, U1&rsquo;s appreciation for the predictability and routine of shows like <em>Criminal Minds</em> suggests that the familiarity and repetition of tropes can also enhance viewing experience. However, they can also detract from a film&rsquo;s attractiveness, as seen with U6&rsquo;s evaluation of <em>Hunter Killer</em>. This suggests that the significance of tropes varies based on individual viewer investment and preference. Recognizing a trope requires first knowing it exists; therefore trope recognition was limited to genres that the participants knew well.&nbsp; Tropes are a way that users go beyond the coarse genre labels to make fine-grained classifications necessary to identify what they really like.

                        Um, <em>Tom and Jerry</em>, literally a cartoon for kids.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        [<em>Scooby Doo</em>] Cartoon for kids.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        [<em>Nicky Ricky Dicky &amp; Dawn</em>] Um, maybe something for like pre-teens or something, this looks like children, Disney show.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        Um, <em>Cobra Kai</em>, I know &hellip; I&rsquo;ve watched this before, it just didn&rsquo;t hook me.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <em>Jane the Virgin</em>. Probably for women, or kids, or having kids, having babies. Not interested.

                <h4>Situational Suitability</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        Like I said, I want to relax, right? I don&rsquo;t want to keep stuck on my toes because of an accident and stuff. So I don&rsquo;t want to watch that. I&rsquo;d rather go for one that makes me relax and smile&hellip;

                    <blockquote>
                        For something like <em>Suits</em>, yes. For something like <em>Fall of the House of Usher</em>, no &hellip; because that&rsquo;s one where I&rsquo;m watching for the story &hellip; I actually care about what's happening &hellip; It&rsquo;s really about whether or not I feel like I have to pay attention.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>The hard part is, I need a show that is like a B rating in my mind because I can tune out, and it won&rsquo;t matter. But it&rsquo;s so hard because I have pretty extreme opinions.</blockquote>
                <h4>Social and Moral Acceptability</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        In Nigerian movies, before now, they moderate certain contents because of its social acceptability, so um, gender kind of movies were not really made in Nigeria because, of course, it's a highly patriarchal society. So, you won&rsquo;t really find movies like <em>Woman King</em> trending in Nigeria. But because I have that interest in international norms &hellip; movies like this would appeal to me, regardless of the fact that I&rsquo;m coming from a patriarchal society where those things are not. These are some of the, um, should I say, silent conversations I have within me while I&rsquo;m thinking of what movies to watch &hellip; but again, I don&rsquo;t want to watch movies that are extreme because I also want to be able to have conversations about them and feel comfortable having those conversations with my friends, especially with my family and my wife.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        Wait, is this the guy who&rsquo;s in <em>Criminal Minds</em>? &hellip; I love that man, so much &hellip; But the hard part is, too, I want to be, at least semi culturally conscious when I'm picking police-themed TV shows, because I&rsquo;m like, am I glorifying the profession by watching it?
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        That one I&rsquo;m not so sure about. I&rsquo;ve seen the other one, <em>Love on the Spectrum</em>, and it made me feel kinda weird.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        [Interviewer: Why?]
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        I don&rsquo;t know. Something about it isn&rsquo;t right. It treads this odd line where it&rsquo;s like, on one hand, the show will be very heartwarming and hopeful and like, human and kind. But then it will also try to be funny and entertaining and will make fun of their autism. It feels predatory &hellip; I have very complicated feelings towards that show, and this feels very similar to that, so no.
